Aquarius Wallet Web Project

- Make sure the proto files are built for the project (go to root and run the build_protos script)
- Make sure the server is built (and running)
- `npm run run-client`

TODOS

- Responsive grid system w/ touch control
- API implementation
- accessibility handling (screen readers / navigators, color blindness, etc)
- simple localization system
- basic design guide
- refactor everything to be more mvvm-like since you're using the context api as a viewmodel anyway...
- or stop doing that
- cute little QR codes people love that stuff
